This is the data folder to copy in your wiki dataRoot folder.

It contains the default template and template items.

Also see fantomato.conf which is the main config file
(each namespace also has it's own config as well)

You should create your own templates in the template folder.

You only need to copy/modify the items you want to change, missing items
will be fetched from the default template automatically.

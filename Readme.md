Fantomato is a Wiki / blog engine written in Fantom.
This is a port / rewrite of my all java engine called JotWiki.

It supports rendering Markdown, JotWiki(Dokuwiki) and plain HTML pages within templates.
The content can be .html or .md or .txt(in jotwiki format ~= creole)

The templates use Mustache for variables & basic  logic.

It has quite a lot of features but work in progress fo now.

TODO:

explin templates (+ variables / file imports)

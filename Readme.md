Fantomato is a Wiki / blog engine written in Fantom.
This is a port / rewrite of my old java engine called JotWiki.

It supports rendering Markdown, JotWiki(Dokuwiki) and plain HTML pages within templates.
The content can be .html or .md or .txt(in jotwiki format, simiar to docuwiki / creole)

The templates use Mustache for variables & basic  logic.

It has quite a lot of features but work in progress fo now.

TODO:
It' still work in progress at this point, More documentation will come soon.
